## AutoLayer

The project includes an advanced automation system designed to enhance blockchain interactions. This system has two primary functions. First, it monitors two specific third-party blockchain addresses, and upon their interaction with a designated smart contract, it triggers the user’s blockchain address to perform a subsequent action with the same contract. 

This ensures seamless and automated engagement based on predefined conditions. Second, the system continuously monitors the stability of a specific stablecoin. In the event of a depeg, where the stablecoin loses its pegged value, it automatically swaps the unstable stablecoin for a more secure and stable alternative, maintaining financial stability and reducing user risk. 

The project leverages Chainlink Automation to manage and execute these automated processes on the blockchain, ensuring precise triggering of smart contracts. Additionally, The Graph’s indexing and querying capabilities are utilized to efficiently handle on-chain data, enabling swift and accurate responses to blockchain changes and interactions. Designed with user efficiency in mind, this project aims to benefit DeFi users by enhancing on-chain operational efficiency and increasing financial security through robust automated processes.
